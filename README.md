# blog-de-cafe
This coffee blog was made using HTML, CSS and a bit of Javascript.

By doing this I learned:

- DOM Manipulation: Using JavaScript to interact with HTML elements, modify their content, attributes, and styles dynamically, and respond to user actions such as clicks or form submissions.
- Event Handling
- Form Validation: To validate the form located in "contacto.html"
- Error Handling and Debugging
